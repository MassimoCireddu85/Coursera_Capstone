    "<h4><b>Background</b><br>Recent years trends and market conjunctions are increasingly provoking technological advancements in the agriculture industry. <br>\n",
    "Growing population in urban areas and scarcity of free soil for crop farming together with the marginal cost advantage of robotics and automation which is now more affordable also for small enterprises, led to the development of new farming techniques such as vertical farming, rooftop farming and hydropronics.<br></p>\n",
    "<b>Interest</b><br>    \n",
    "Aim of this project is to explore suitable locations to start a vertical farming business in the city of Rome. The locations taken into exam will be abandoned public buildings around the city.<br>\n",
    "The target customers will be collateral businesses which may take advantage of the proximity with the farm (see data section). The project seeks also to foster the culture of reutilization of public spaces.</h4>\n",
